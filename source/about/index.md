I'm Michał, full-stack developer in love with crafting things for web. I code all kinds of webapps from monolithic applications to modular SPAs today since beginning of my developer life. I work with Scala, Javascript (both client and server-side). Founder of Łódź meet.js meetings, active member of JUG Łódź, speaker at local meetups as well as developer conferences (Confitura, GeeCON, 4Developers i AgileByExample). I work fully-remote at [SoftwareMill](http://softwaremill.com")
