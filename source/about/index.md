I'm Michal, full-stack developer in love with crafting things for web. I usually work with Scala and Javascript (both client and server-side). I'm founder of Lodz meet.js meetings and active member of JUG Lodz as well as speaker at local meetups and developer conferences (Confitura, GeeCON, 4Developers i AgileByExample). I'm also dad, amateur runner, guitar player and Chelsea FC supporter.

I work fully-remote with awesome crew at [SoftwareMill](http://softwaremill.com").
