	My name is Michal Ostruszka. I'm software developer and technical team leader based in Łódź, Poland. I like creating apps for web. At work I code mostly in java on java ee stack. Off-hours I play a bit with other languages like groovy, ruby, javascript and coffescript. Recently I dive into functional languages world, scala in particular. I'm test-infected. I craft my code with tdd and I care about simple design, code quality and readability. I'm agile proponent and believe that agile software development is not about "scrum" and "daily stand-ups" buzzwords.
