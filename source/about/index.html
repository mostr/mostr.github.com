<p>
I'm software developer and technical team leader based in Lodz, Poland. I like creating apps for web. At work I code in java on java ee stack. Off-hours I also play with other languages like groovy, ruby, javascript and coffescript. Recently I carefully dive into scala world. I'm test-infected. I craft my code with tdd and, really care about simple design, code quality and readability. I believe that agile software development is not about scrum and daily stand-ups. You can find me on JUG Lodz (Java User Group) and LRUG (Lodz Ruby Users Group) meetups.
