This year at Global Day of Code Retreat event in Lodz we had 57 developers. It was big surprise for us, organizators as we were expecting that not all registered people would be ready to get up early on Saturday and devote whole day to coding with others. As far as I know we were third of the biggest Code Retreat events that day :) It was my first Code Retreat as facilitator and I must say, being facilitator is much more exhaustive than being regular attendee. I was completely tired after that whole day but if I had to facilitate next Code Retreat on the following Sunday I'd definitely do that. It was awesome day. So what it was all about? We decided to start officially at 8:30am with breakfast and coffee first. We also hanged out with Code Retreaters in Australia to say hello. Then Pawel Wlodarski introduced the whole Code Retreat idea and explained the problem of the day "Game of Life". After all the introductions and seeing Corey's welcome video we fired up first "no constraints" session. Actually there were some not explicit constraints. We asked all the participants to treat tests seriously, write them, write tests-first and treat tests as regular code. Some of them had heard about TDD before but there were a few who had never written any serious tests. This session was devoted to getting familiar with problem, with tests-first and pair programming ideas (for those who had never experienced that before). Because we had about 60 participants we decided to divide them into 3 groups for retrospection (as there were three of us, facilitators). I can say it was a great choice as it was much easier to control and drive discussion in group od 20 people than 60 people. The only retrospection with the group as a whole was the one after last session. We had bunch of session constraints prepared and were choosing next session's topic on the go basing our decisions on how the previous one was going. To keep the pace and to focus even more on TDD and pair programming we did Ping-Pong TDD a core of second session. Additional constraint was to keep methods short (max 5 lines). Third one was about adding one more constraint: one indentation level per method (one abstraction per method). After lunch we did "no-mouse" session. We had paper copies of key shortcut cheat sheets prepared for IDEs we were expecting and it turned out a lot of pairs found it really useful. Additional requirement for that session was to wrap primitive types into domain objects. Then we did "choose what you want" session. We displayed and briefly explained Object Callisthenics by Jeff Bay and asked participants to stick to whatever they want from the list. At the end of this session we asked attendees not to delete their code, which was quite surprising as they were used to do that on every session's end. That's because we arranged Code Swap as the last session. It was the last one finished by one big retrospection. After that we had short video conf with guys from Ecuador to say hello and wish them happy GDCR.
Judging from feedback forms we mailed to participants next day the event was really great. There is a number of things mentioned in feedback form or during retrospections that they learned during that day. These are things as simple as "unit testing", "key shortcuts", "TDD", but also like "comparing two different approaches to software development: outside-in and inside-out" and so on. We also received a lot of comments with improvements proposals. Clearly there is a lot of things to do before next GDCR but I personally feel it was realy good day and I'm proud I could be a part of it and facilitate such awesome global event. Even if I wasn't coding that day I can say I've learnt a lot. 
I'd like to thank to all participants here in Lodz and over the world for making that day really special and encourage you to join next time if you haven't had a chance to be at Code Retreat before. We hope not to wait until next GDCR and run something local during upcoming year.
